 A task for Flashy company.
 
 Plaese run the functions that in index.php one after another to check if it's working correctly.
 
 ## Notes:
 
 * If I'd taken it to the next step, I'd create each row as a different file so I don't have to load all the data every time.
 
 * Each table should get a schema on table creation so I could validate the fields in every insert / update: 
   required, type, maxLength, default, nullable etc.
   
 * Create classes that will represent table that will handle all table operations.
